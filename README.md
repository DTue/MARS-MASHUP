# MARS
MARS (official) MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator

 MARS is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.
 MARS was developed by Pete Sanderson and Ken Vollmar and can be found at https://dpetersanderson.github.io/.

 This fork of MARS is a research project undertaken by John Edelman, Jun Law, and Dominic Dabish in summer 2025, aiming to modernize MARS and specifically to enable students to specify their own custom assembly languages for use with the MARS simulator.

In this customized MARS, aiming to mimic an audio engineering program, users are able to mix and matches track together similar to the role of a music producer. 
Instructions include terminology from the area of music production such as sample, dj, record, mute, boost, blend, and others that mimics music production tools or actions - more details can be found in the program's library. 
To run and test the program in MARS LE, please simply copy the Music.java and ensure the file is placed under customlangs. From there, user needs to build a jar file and place under customlangs file(same as Music.java). Once task is completed, user can relaunch the mars program and our customized music assembly language should be placed under language switcher section.
